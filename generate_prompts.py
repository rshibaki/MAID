    "As part of your INTERNAL thinking (not to be output):\n"
    "1. Note the percentage chance of each possible outcome for both options.\n"
    "2. Consider what it would mean for the patient’s wishes if each outcome occurs, and also if it does not occur.\n"
    "3. Judge which option is better for the patient’s wishes by thinking about both how likely each outcome is and how big its effect would be.\n"
    "4. Recognize and factor in any differences in the chances of desirable or undesirable outcomes.\n"
    "5. Compare how well each option, with its certainty or uncertainty, aligns with the patient’s wishes. Before making your choice, remind yourself that the option labels and their order are arbitrary and do not indicate any preference. Then choose one, taking into account your role and any inherent biases.\n\n"
